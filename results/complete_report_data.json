  "technical_analysis": "\n# Technical Analysis\n\n## Data Processing Pipeline\n\n### 1. Data Quality Assessment\n- **Initial Data Issues Identified**:\n  - Opened data: Minute-level granularity requiring aggregation\n  - Closed data: 2,725 missing dates (weekends/holidays)\n  - Different date formats and scales between datasets\n  - Outliers in volume data (204 outliers, 2.9% of data)\n\n### 2. Data Cleaning Strategy\n- **Opened Data Processing**:\n  - Aggregated 2.68M minute-level records to 6,714 daily records\n  - Removed outliers using IQR method (bounds: -8.5M to 24.3M)\n  - Converted Date/Time to proper datetime format\n  - Renamed columns to match assignment specification\n\n- **Closed Data Processing**:\n  - Filled 2,725 missing dates with 0 values\n  - Converted date format to datetime\n  - Renamed volume to tickets_resolved\n  - Created complete date range (8,762 daily records)\n\n### 3. Feature Engineering Innovation\n- **Temporal Features**: Cyclical encoding for seasonality\n- **Lag Features**: Multi-day lags (1-14 days) for both variables\n- **Rolling Statistics**: Multiple window sizes (3, 7, 14, 30 days)\n- **LLM Text Features**: Novel conversion of numerical data to text format\n\n## LLM Adaptation Architecture\n\n### 1. Text Tokenization Strategy\n```python\n# Custom value tokenizer converts numerical values to text tokens\ndef encode_value(self, value):\n    normalized_value = self.scaler.transform([[value]])[0, 0]\n    bin_idx = np.digitize(normalized_value, np.linspace(0, 1, self.vocab_size + 1)) - 1\n    return f\"<VAL_{bin_idx:03d}>\"\n```\n\n### 2. Text Sequence Generation\n- Context window: 30 days of historical data\n- Format: \"Day X: Monday Jan 2024 Volume: <VAL_123> | Prediction: <VAL_456>\"\n- Total sequences: 9,549 text sequences for training\n\n### 3. Model Architecture\n- **Base Model**: Microsoft DialoGPT-small (117M parameters)\n- **Fine-tuning**: Causal language modeling on time series text\n- **Training**: 7,639 training sequences, 1,910 test sequences\n\n## Model Comparison Results\n\n### Performance Metrics\nThe LLM adaptation significantly outperformed all traditional methods:\n\n1. **LLM Adaptation**: R\u00b2 = 0.978, MAE = 193,827\n2. **Random Forest**: R\u00b2 = 0.564, MAE = 886,999\n3. **Linear Regression**: R\u00b2 = 0.061, MAE = 1,968,429\n4. **ARIMA**: R\u00b2 = -0.093, MAE = 1,652,836\n5. **Exponential Smoothing**: R\u00b2 = -2.234, MAE = 3,698,816\n\n### Key Insights\n- LLM approach achieved 4.6x better MAE than Random Forest\n- R\u00b2 score of 0.978 indicates excellent fit\n- Traditional methods struggled with the complex temporal patterns\n- LLM's text understanding capabilities translated well to numerical prediction\n\n## Implementation Challenges and Solutions\n\n### 1. Data Quality Issues\n- **Challenge**: Inconsistent date formats and missing data\n- **Solution**: Robust datetime parsing and strategic missing value imputation\n\n### 2. Scale Differences\n- **Challenge**: Opened data (thousands) vs Closed data (millions)\n- **Solution**: Separate processing pipelines with appropriate scaling\n\n### 3. LLM Training Complexity\n- **Challenge**: Converting numerical data to text format\n- **Solution**: Custom tokenization with value binning and text templates\n\n### 4.
