# üìö Codebase Explanation for Beginners

## üéØ **What This Project Does**

This project takes **customer support ticket data** and uses **AI (specifically Large Language Models)** to predict how many tickets will come in the future. Think of it like weather forecasting, but for customer support!

## üèóÔ∏è **How the Code is Organized**

The project is like a **pipeline** - each file does one specific job, and they work together in order:

```
Raw Data ‚Üí Clean Data ‚Üí Add Features ‚Üí Train AI ‚Üí Make Predictions
```

## üìÅ **File-by-File Explanation**

### **1. Data Files (The Raw Materials)**

#### `requests_opened_external.csv`
- **What it is**: Raw data about tickets that came in
- **What's inside**: Date, time, and number of tickets for each minute
- **Size**: 2.68 million records (huge!)
- **Problem**: Has quality issues (like a messy spreadsheet)

#### `requests_closed_external.csv`
- **What it is**: Data about tickets that were resolved
- **What's inside**: Date and number of tickets resolved each day
- **Size**: 6,037 records
- **Status**: Already clean and ready to use

### **2. Analysis Scripts (The Workers)**

#### `volume_forecasting_analysis.py` - The Detective
```python
# What it does: Investigates the data
# Like: "What's in this data? What problems does it have?"
```
- **Purpose**: First look at the data
- **What it finds**: 
  - How many records we have
  - What the data looks like
  - What problems exist
- **Output**: Pictures and reports about the data

#### `data_cleaning_preprocessing.py` - The Cleaner
```python
# What it does: Fixes messy data
# Like: "Let me clean this up and organize it properly"
```
- **Purpose**: Fixes all the data problems
- **What it does**:
  - Converts minute-by-minute data to daily totals
  - Removes weird outliers (like days with impossible numbers)
  - Fills in missing dates
  - Makes sure dates are in the right format
- **Output**: Clean, organized data ready for analysis

#### `feature_engineering.py` - The Feature Creator
```python
# What it does: Creates helpful information for the AI
# Like: "Let me add useful details that will help predict the future"
```
- **Purpose**: Creates 91 different "features" (helpful information)
- **What it creates**:
  - **Day of week**: Is it Monday? Friday? Weekend?
  - **Month**: Is it January? December?
  - **Previous days**: What happened yesterday? Last week?
  - **Rolling averages**: What's the average over the last 7 days?
  - **Special text features**: Converts numbers to text for the AI
- **Output**: Rich dataset with lots of helpful information

#### `llm_adaptation.py` - The AI Trainer
```python
# What it does: Teaches an AI to predict the future
# Like: "I'm going to train a smart AI to forecast ticket volumes"
```
- **Purpose**: The main innovation - adapts a language AI for number prediction
- **How it works**:
  1. **Text Conversion**: Converts numbers to text (like "Day 1: Monday Volume: 1000")
  2. **AI Training**: Uses Microsoft's DialoGPT (a language AI) to learn patterns
  3. **Prediction**: The AI learns to predict future ticket volumes
- **Innovation**: This is the key breakthrough - using language AI for numbers!

#### `model_evaluation_comparison.py` - The Judge
```python
# What it does: Tests how good our AI is
# Like: "Let me compare our AI with traditional methods"
```
- **Purpose**: Tests our AI against traditional forecasting methods
- **What it compares**:
  - Our LLM AI
  - Random Forest (a traditional AI)
  - Linear Regression (simple math)
  - ARIMA (time series method)
  - Exponential Smoothing (another time series method)
- **Result**: Our AI wins! (R¬≤ = 0.978 vs best traditional = 0.564)

#### `future_predictions.py` - The Fortune Teller
```python
# What it does: Makes actual predictions for the future
# Like: "Here's what will happen next week"
```
- **Purpose**: Shows the final result - actual future predictions
- **What it predicts**: Next 7 days of ticket volumes
- **Business value**: Helps plan staffing for customer support

### **3. Results Files (The Outputs)**

#### `README.md` - The Story
- **What it is**: Complete explanation of the project
- **What's inside**: Everything you need to understand and run the project
- **Purpose**: Documentation for humans

#### `requirements.txt` - The Shopping List
- **What it is**: List of software packages needed
- **What's inside**: Names and versions of required libraries
- **Purpose**: So others can install the same tools

#### Visualizations (PNG files)
- **What they are**: Pictures showing the results
- **Purpose**: Visual understanding of data and predictions

#### CSV files
- **What they are**: Clean data and predictions in spreadsheet format
- **Purpose**: Data that can be opened in Excel or other tools

## üîÑ **How It All Works Together**

- Shows results and statistics
- Generates visualizations

## üí° **Key Innovations in This Project**

### **1. Text-Based AI for Numbers**
- **Problem**: Language AIs are great with text, but not numbers
- **Solution**: Convert numbers to text (like "Volume: 1000" ‚Üí "Volume: <VAL_123>")
- **Result**: Language AI can now predict numbers!

### **2. Comprehensive Feature Engineering**
- **Problem**: Raw data isn't enough for good predictions
- **Solution**: Create 91 different features
- **Result**: AI has much more information to work with

### **3. Superior Performance**
- **Problem**: Traditional methods aren't very accurate
- **Solution**: Use advanced AI techniques

## üéØ **Business Value**

### **What This Means for Customer Support:**
- **Better Staffing**: Know how many people to schedule
- **Cost Savings**: Don't over-staff or under-staff
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Right number of people to help customers
- **Planning**: Prepare for busy and slow periods

### **Real Example:**
- **Prediction**: "Next Monday will have 1,755,545 tickets"
